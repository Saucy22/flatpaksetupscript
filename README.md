#Calebs Flatpak Setup Script
A python script that automatically sets up flatpak and flathub for you. For people too lazy to go to the flatpak website and copy and paste the instructions (me). 

#Usage
Simply download the .py file from this repo and run it using 'python3 FlatpakSetup.py'

#Why?
Saves a couple of seconds when your setting up new installs. Having this script handy is a bit of a time save.
Im considering writing a linux distrohoppers toolkit one of these days. This script would be a part of it.
